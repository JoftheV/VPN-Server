# VPN Project Dependencies

This document lists all dependencies required to set up, develop, and maintain the VPN service based on OpenVPN on an Ubuntu server. It includes software packages, libraries, and tools necessary for the operation and management of the VPN.

## Operating System

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer

## Software Packages

These packages need to be installed on Ubuntu for the VPN service to function correctly:

- `openvpn`: The core VPN software that creates secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections.
- `easy-rsa`: A CLI utility to manage a PKI CA for generating and managing SSL certificates.
- `openssl`: A robust toolkit for SSL and TLS protocols, necessary for creating encrypted connections.
- `ufw`: Uncomplicated Firewall for managing network rules, ensuring secure access to the VPN server.

### Installation Commands

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa openssl ufw -y

Configuration and Management Tools

	•	git: Version control system for tracking changes in the project and collaborating.
	•	ansible (optional): For automating the deployment and configuration of VPN servers across environments.

Installation Commands

sudo apt install git -y
sudo apt install ansible -y  # Optional

Analytical and Monitoring Tools

To ensure the VPN operates efficiently and securely, the following tools are recommended:

	•	iperf3: For testing network bandwidth between the VPN server and clients.
	•	nmap: Security scanner for discovering hosts and services on a computer network, thus finding open ports and detecting security risks.
	•	logwatch: A customizable log analysis system, useful for monitoring and analyzing VPN server logs.
	•	zabbix-agent: To monitor server performance and health.

Installation Commands

sudo apt install iperf3 nmap logwatch zabbix-agent -y

Development Dependencies

For developers contributing to the VPN project, the following tools and libraries are recommended:

	•	docker: For creating, deploying, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
	•	virtualenv: A tool to create isolated Python environments, useful for Python-based management or automation scripts.

Installation Commands

sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo apt install python3-virtualenv -y

Security and Compliance Tools

	•	fail2ban: Intrusion prevention software framework that protects the server from brute-force attacks.
	•	openvas: Full-featured vulnerability scanner.

Installation Commands

sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mrazavi/openvas
sudo apt install openvas -y

Please note that specific versions and configurations may vary based on the project’s current state and future updates. Regularly review and update this document to reflect changes in the project’s dependencies.

This `DEPENDENCIES.md` file serves as a comprehensive list that project maintainers, developers, and system administrators can refer to when setting up or maintaining the VPN service. It's crucial to keep this document updated as the project evolves to ensure all team members and contributors are aligned on the project's requirements.

### Configuring Software Dependencies

**1. OpenVPN Installation:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```
- **Configuration**: Copy the example server configuration as a starting point and adjust according to your needs.
```bash
cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/
gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz
nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```
- **Note**: Modify `server.conf` to specify your server's network configuration, encryption protocols, and any custom settings such as port number or logging verbosity.

**2. Easy-RSA Setup:**
```bash
sudo apt install easy-rsa -y
make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
cd ~/openvpn-ca
```
- **Configuration**: Populate the `vars` file with your organization's information to streamline certificate creation.
```bash
nano vars
```
- Initialize the PKI and build the CA:
```bash
./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca
```

**3. OpenSSL:**
- Generally, OpenSSL is pre-installed on Ubuntu systems. Ensure it's up to date:
```bash
sudo apt install openssl -y
```
- **Configuration**: OpenSSL configurations are typically managed within Easy-RSA or OpenVPN configurations and do not require separate handling.

**4. Firewall and Routing Configuration:**
- Install `ufw` for an easier firewall management experience:
```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
```
- **Configuration**: Define rules to allow necessary traffic (e.g., SSH, OpenVPN default port 1194):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```
- Enable IP forwarding to allow traffic between clients:
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Configuring Analytical Dependencies

**1. Network Load Analysis with `iperf`:**
- Install `iperf`:
```bash
sudo apt install iperf -y
```
- **Usage**: Start `iperf` in server mode on the VPN server and connect from a client to measure bandwidth.

**2. Security Vulnerability Assessment with `nmap`:**
- Install `nmap`:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap -y
```
- **Usage**: Use `nmap` to scan your VPN server’s IP address for open ports and potential vulnerabilities.

**3. Log Analysis with `Logwatch`:**
- Install `Logwatch`:
```bash
sudo apt install logwatch -y
```
- **Configuration**: Configure `logwatch` to monitor OpenVPN log files by editing its configuration file and setting the appropriate log file paths.

**4. Performance Monitoring with `Zabbix`:**
- Install `Zabbix` (simplified; refer to Zabbix documentation for a full setup):
```bash
sudo apt install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php zabbix-agent -y
```
- **Configuration**: Set up `Zabbix` to monitor system metrics, including custom metrics for OpenVPN, by adding OpenVPN status file monitoring to Zabbix's configuration.

### Final Steps and Verification

After configuring the software and analytical dependencies:

- **Verify OpenVPN Functionality**: Start the OpenVPN server and connect a client to ensure the VPN is functioning as expected.
- **Test Firewall Rules**: Verify that your firewall rules are correctly set up to allow VPN traffic and SSH access.
- **Check Analytical Tools**: Ensure that your analytical tools are properly configured and collecting data. Review initial reports or logs to confirm everything is operational.

Regularly update all dependencies to maintain security and functionality. Additionally, keep documentation of your configuration choices and any custom scripts used to automate setup or monitoring tasks, as they will be invaluable for maintenance and troubleshooting.
