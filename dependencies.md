To configure the dependencies for an OpenVPN server setup effectively, you'll need to address both the software installation and the analytical tools that monitor and maintain the VPN's performance and security. Here's a comprehensive approach to configuring these dependencies on a Linux system (assuming Ubuntu for package management commands), along with setting up the analytical tools that support ongoing operations.

### Configuring Software Dependencies

**1. OpenVPN Installation:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvpn -y
```
- **Configuration**: Copy the example server configuration as a starting point and adjust according to your needs.
```bash
cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/
gzip -d /etc/openvpn/server.conf.gz
nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
```
- **Note**: Modify `server.conf` to specify your server's network configuration, encryption protocols, and any custom settings such as port number or logging verbosity.

**2. Easy-RSA Setup:**
```bash
sudo apt install easy-rsa -y
make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
cd ~/openvpn-ca
```
- **Configuration**: Populate the `vars` file with your organization's information to streamline certificate creation.
```bash
nano vars
```
- Initialize the PKI and build the CA:
```bash
./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca
```

**3. OpenSSL:**
- Generally, OpenSSL is pre-installed on Ubuntu systems. Ensure it's up to date:
```bash
sudo apt install openssl -y
```
- **Configuration**: OpenSSL configurations are typically managed within Easy-RSA or OpenVPN configurations and do not require separate handling.

**4. Firewall and Routing Configuration:**
- Install `ufw` for an easier firewall management experience:
```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
```
- **Configuration**: Define rules to allow necessary traffic (e.g., SSH, OpenVPN default port 1194):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
```
- Enable IP forwarding to allow traffic between clients:
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### Configuring Analytical Dependencies

**1. Network Load Analysis with `iperf`:**
- Install `iperf`:
```bash
sudo apt install iperf -y
```
- **Usage**: Start `iperf` in server mode on the VPN server and connect from a client to measure bandwidth.

**2. Security Vulnerability Assessment with `nmap`:**
- Install `nmap`:
```bash
sudo apt install nmap -y
```
- **Usage**: Use `nmap` to scan your VPN serverâ€™s IP address for open ports and potential vulnerabilities.

**3. Log Analysis with `Logwatch`:**
- Install `Logwatch`:
```bash
sudo apt install logwatch -y
```
- **Configuration**: Configure `logwatch` to monitor OpenVPN log files by editing its configuration file and setting the appropriate log file paths.

**4. Performance Monitoring with `Zabbix`:**
- Install `Zabbix` (simplified; refer to Zabbix documentation for a full setup):
```bash
sudo apt install zabbix-server-mysql zabbix-frontend-php zabbix-agent -y
```
- **Configuration**: Set up `Zabbix` to monitor system metrics, including custom metrics for OpenVPN, by adding OpenVPN status file monitoring to Zabbix's configuration.

### Final Steps and Verification

After configuring the software and analytical dependencies:

- **Verify OpenVPN Functionality**: Start the OpenVPN server and connect a client to ensure the VPN is functioning as expected.
- **Test Firewall Rules**: Verify that your firewall rules are correctly set up to allow VPN traffic and SSH access.
- **Check Analytical Tools**: Ensure that your analytical tools are properly configured and collecting data. Review initial reports or logs to confirm everything is operational.

Regularly update all dependencies to maintain security and functionality. Additionally, keep documentation of your configuration choices and any custom scripts used to automate setup or monitoring tasks, as they will be invaluable for maintenance and troubleshooting.
