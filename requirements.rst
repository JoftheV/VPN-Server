Requirements for Setting Up OpenVPN
====================================

This document outlines the system and software requirements, installation instructions, and dependencies needed to set up an OpenVPN server on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It serves as a foundational guide for administrators and IT professionals tasked with deploying a secure and efficient VPN service.

System Requirements
-------------------

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or newer. Compatibility with other Linux distributions should be verified.
- **CPU**: Minimum 1GHz processor. Multi-core processor recommended for high-traffic environments.
- **RAM**: At least 1GB, with 2GB or more recommended for better performance under load.
- **Disk Space**: 10GB minimum, with additional space for logs and user data.
- **Network Interface**: One or more Ethernet interfaces with a static IP address for the VPN server.

Software Requirements
---------------------

- **OpenVPN**: Version 2.4 or later.
- **Easy-RSA**: Version 3.0.8 or later, for managing the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
- **OpenSSL**: Version 1.1.1 or later, usually included with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. **System Update**: Ensure your system packages are up to date:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. **Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa -y

Configuration Recommendations
------------------------------

- It is essential to configure OpenVPN with security best practices in mind. Refer to `security-best-practices.md` for detailed recommendations on setting encryption standards and authentication methods.

- For configuring the Certificate Authority (CA) and generating server/client certificates, follow the steps outlined in `setup-guide.md`.

Additional Dependencies
-----------------------

- Depending on your specific setup, additional dependencies such as `ufw` for firewall configuration or `fail2ban` for preventing brute force attacks might be necessary. Install these tools as required:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install ufw fail2ban -y

Post-Installation Steps
------------------------

- After installing OpenVPN and its dependencies, proceed with the configuration of the VPN server, client profiles, and networking settings as per the instructions in `setup-guide.md`.

- Ensure you test your VPN server thoroughly before deploying it into a production environment. See `testing-guide.md` for testing protocols.

Maintenance Requirements
------------------------

Regular maintenance and updates are critical for the security and performance of your VPN server:

- **Software Updates**: Apply security patches and updates to the OpenVPN package, Easy-RSA, and the operating system regularly.

- **Certificate Management**: Monitor the expiration dates of your certificates and renew them as needed to maintain uninterrupted service.

Refer to `maintenance-guide.md` for a detailed maintenance plan and schedule.

By following these requirements and guidelines, you will establish a solid foundation for deploying and maintaining a secure, reliable OpenVPN server.
