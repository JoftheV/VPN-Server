For a comprehensive OpenVPN server setup, providing detailed documentation is crucial for both deployment and ongoing maintenance. Below, you'll find templates for a `README.md` file and a `requirements.rst` file that outline essential information, dependencies, setup instructions, and maintenance guidelines tailored to your VPN service.

# OpenVPN Server Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up an OpenVPN server, including prerequisites, installation, configuration, and maintenance. It is designed for system administrators and IT professionals responsible for implementing a secure VPN service.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux server (Ubuntu recommended) with root access.
- Basic understanding of networking and Linux command-line interfaces.

## Dependencies

Ensure your system is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA:

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa -y
```

## Configuration Steps

1. **Update Your System**: Ensure all packages are up-to-date.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA.

3. **Certificate Authority Setup**: Initialize your PKI and create the CA.

4. **Server and Client Certificates**: Generate the necessary certificates and keys.

5. **Server Configuration**: Configure your OpenVPN server.

6. **Client Configuration**: Prepare client profile files.

7. **Networking and Security**: Adjust firewall and routing settings.

Detailed instructions for each step are available in the `setup-guide.md`.

## Testing

- **Local Testing**: Test the VPN connection within the local network.

- **Remote Testing**: Ensure remote connections are stable and secure.

- **Security and Load Testing**: Perform comprehensive security audits and load testing.

Refer to `testing-guide.md` for detailed testing procedures.

## Deployment

Follow the deployment checklist in `deployment-checklist.md` to ensure all components are correctly configured and secured before going live.

## Maintenance and Updates

Regular maintenance tasks include updating software, renewing certificates, managing users, and conducting security audits. Refer to `maintenance-guide.md` for a detailed maintenance schedule and best practices.
