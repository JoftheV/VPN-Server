# OpenVPN Server Setup and Documentation

This comprehensive guide details the setup, configuration, testing, deployment, and maintenance of an OpenVPN server. It is designed for IT professionals, system administrators, and anyone interested in implementing a secure VPN service.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- An Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server with root access.
- Familiarity with Linux command line, networking concepts, IP routing, and firewall configuration.

## Getting Started

### Update and Install Dependencies

First, update your system and install OpenVPN and Easy-RSA:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa -y
```

### Configuration Overview

1. **Certificate Authority Setup**: Initialize the PKI directory and create the CA.
2. **Generate Server and Client Certificates**: Create certificates and keys for both server and clients.
3. **Configure the OpenVPN Server**: Adjust settings for network and encryption.
4. **Prepare Client Configurations**: Create client profile files for easy setup.

A step-by-step guide is available in [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md), including command examples and configuration options.

### Networking and Security

Ensure proper IP forwarding and firewall settings are configured to allow VPN traffic. Consult the [security-best-practices.md](security-best-practices.md) for recommendations on hardening your VPN server.

## Testing

Ensure thorough testing both locally and remotely to verify configuration and security. Guidelines for conducting tests can be found in [testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md).

## Deployment

Before going live, follow the pre-deployment checklist available in [deployment-checklist.md](deployment-checklist.md) to ensure all systems are configured correctly.

## Maintenance and Updates

Routine tasks such as applying updates, managing user access, and renewing certificates are crucial for maintaining your VPN server's security and performance. Detailed maintenance strategies are outlined in [maintenance-guide.md](maintenance-guide.md).
