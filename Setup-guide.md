# OpenVPN Setup Guide

This document provides detailed steps for setting up an OpenVPN server on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Certificate Authority (CA) Setup

1. Initialize the PKI directory:
   ```bash
   make-cadir ~/openvpn-ca
   cd ~/openvpn-ca

	2.	Configure vars file with your company details.
	3.	Build the CA:

./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca



Server and Client Certificates

	1.	Generate the server certificate and key:

./easyrsa gen-req server nopass
./easyrsa sign-req server server


	2.	Create a client certificate (repeat for each client):

./easyrsa gen-req client1 nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client client1



OpenVPN Server Configuration

	1.	Copy the example server configuration to /etc/openvpn/server.conf.
	2.	Edit server.conf to adjust port, encryption settings, and network routes as necessary.

Client Configuration

	1.	Generate a client profile with embedded certificates for ease of use.

Firewall and Routing

	1.	Enable IP forwarding:

echo 'net.ipv4.ip_forward=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p


	2.	Configure your firewall to allow VPN traffic and forward it appropriately.

For a full list of configuration options and detailed steps, refer to the OpenVPN documentation.

# OpenVPN Testing Guide

Testing your VPN setup is crucial to ensure security and functionality. Follow these steps:

## Local Testing

1. Connect to the VPN server from a client on the same network.
2. Verify the connection is established, and the client can access network resources.

## Remote Testing

1. Attempt connections from various external networks (home, mobile data, etc.).
2. Ensure connections are stable and data is routed through the VPN server.

## Security Testing

1. Use tools like `nmap` to check for exposed services on the VPN server.
2. Verify encryption by inspecting the connection details with OpenVPN logs or client software.

## Load Testing

1. Simulate multiple connections to test the server's capacity and performance under load.
2. Tools like `iperf` can help measure throughput and identify any bandwidth issues.

Record all findings and adjust configurations as necessary for optimal performance and security.
